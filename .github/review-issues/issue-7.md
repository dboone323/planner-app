Follow-up questions — Quantum-workspace

Please answer these so I can provide targeted changes:
1. Do you want this repo to remain a monorepo (projects versioned/released together) or do you prefer splitting independent projects into separate repos?
2. What languages/build systems are used across the projects (Node, Python, Java, Go, mixed)?
3. Are these projects published (npm/Maven/GH Packages) or consumed only internally?
4. Who are the owners/maintainers for each project (so I can propose CODEOWNERS)?
5. Do you want me to generate example files next (pick one): CI workflow YAML, CODEOWNERS, Dependabot config, or a change-detection script?

Reply here with answers and I will generate the requested example file(s).
