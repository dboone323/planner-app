Quick summary — Quantum-workspace review

Summary:
- Repository: dboone323/Quantum-workspace
- Default branch: main
- Purpose: Workspace/monorepo containing multiple projects and automation tooling.
- Notable files observed: Tools/Automation/README.md, Tools/Automation/deploy_workflows_all_projects.sh
- Primary concerns: workspace CI/validation, repo metadata, automation behaviour.

Recommended next step: review the repo-level README and CI to confirm workflow validation is enforced as intended.
