## Summary

This change implements cloud model optimization for AI code review by switching from local codellama model to Ollama cloud models, significantly improving performance and reducing resource consumption.

## Severity Assessment

- Critical Issues: 0
- Major Issues: 0
- Minor Issues: 3

## Detailed Findings

### Critical Issues

None found.

### Major Issues

None found.

### Minor Issues / Suggestions

1. **Incomplete Documentation Updates**: The OA-05_Status_Report.md and OA-05_Testing_Monitoring.md files still reference the old `codellama` model in their command examples and status reports, which could cause confusion for users following the documentation.

2. **Hardcoded Model Reference**: The documentation files contain hardcoded references to the old model name in bash command examples. These should be updated to reflect the new cloud model configuration.

3. **Missing Documentation Cross-References**: The new cloud model optimization documentation should be referenced in the main implementation summary and user guide to ensure users are aware of the performance improvements.

## Recommendations

1. Update all documentation files to consistently reference the new cloud model configuration
2. Modify bash examples in documentation to use the new model or make them parameterized
3. Add cross-references between the cloud optimization documentation and other OA-05 documentation files
4. Consider adding a section in the main user guide about the benefits of cloud models

## Approval Status

APPROVED

The changes are well-implemented and properly documented. The minor documentation inconsistencies do not block the core functionality but should be addressed in a follow-up commit for completeness.
