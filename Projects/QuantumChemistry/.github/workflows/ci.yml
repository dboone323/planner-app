Here is a comprehensive GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow for your Swift project:

1. Build and test on multiple macOS versions:
```yaml
name: QuantumChemistry

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.macos }}
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      max-parallel: 3
      matrix:
        macos: ["macOS Big Sur", "macOS Catalina", "macOS Mojave"]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          xcodebuild -project QuantumChemistry.xcodeproj -target QuantumChemistry -configuration Release
      - name: Build and Test
        run: |
          xcodebuild -project QuantumChemistry.xcodeproj -target QuantumChemistry -configuration Release test
```
This workflow will check out your code, install dependencies with `xcodebuild`, build and test the project on multiple macOS versions using the `run` command. The `strategy` section specifies that up to 3 jobs should run in parallel. The `matrix` section defines the macOS versions that will be used for testing.

2. Code quality checks (SwiftLint, SwiftFormat):
```yaml
name: QuantumChemistry

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  code-quality-checks:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.macos }}
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      max-parallel: 3
      matrix:
        macos: ["macOS Big Sur", "macOS Catalina", "macOS Mojave"]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          xcodebuild -project QuantumChemistry.xcodeproj -target QuantumChemistry -configuration Release
      - name: SwiftLint and SwiftFormat
        uses: lighthouse-Labs/SwiftFormat@v1.0
        env:
          PROJECT_PATH: ${{ github.workspace }}/QuantumChemistry.xcodeproj
```
This workflow will check out your code, install dependencies with `xcodebuild`, and run `swiftlint` and `swiftformat` on the project using the `uses` keyword. The `env` section specifies the path to the Xcode project file that should be used for linting and formatting.

3. Test execution with coverage reporting:
```yaml

```
This workflow will check out your code, install dependencies with `xcodebuild`, build and test the project on multiple macOS versions using the `run` command, and generate a coverage report using the `actions/coverage@v2` action. The `env` section specifies the path to the coverage report file that should be generated.

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          xcodebuild -project QuantumChemistry.xcodeproj -target QuantumChemistry -configuration Release

        uses: actions/coverage@v2
        env:
          COVERAGE_PATH: ${{ github.workspace }}/QuantumChemistry.xcodeproj/reports/coverage-report.html
      - name: Run Dependency Updates
        run: |
          xcodebuild -project QuantumChemistry.xcodeproj -target QuantumChemistry -configuration Release update-dependencies
```
This workflow will check out your code, install dependencies with `xcodebuild`, build and test the project on multiple macOS versions using the `run` command, generate a coverage report using the `actions/coverage@v2` action, and run dependency updates using the `xcodebuild` command. The `env` section specifies the path to the Xcode project file that should be used for building and testing, and the `generate-artifacts` script that will be run after the build and test steps.

Each of these workflows includes a `strategy` section that defines the matrix of macOS versions to test on, and a `steps` section that specifies the commands that should be run for each job. The `uses` keyword is used to specify which actions should be used in each step, such as `actions/checkout@v2` or `actions/coverage@v2`. The `env` section can be used to specify environment variables that will be available during the execution of the workflow.

It's important to note that this is just an example and you may need to modify it to fit your specific needs. Additionally, you should also add error handling and notifications as appropriate for your project.
